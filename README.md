# Clojure in Production

A workshop intended to show off how Clojure can be used to build production software. The workshop assumes prior familiarity with Clojure and the surrounding tooling ecosystem.

## Getting started

- Install JDK 8 or higher. OpenJDK or the [Oracle JDK](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) are both fine.
- Install the [Clojure command line tools](https://clojure.org/guides/getting_started) or [Leiningen](https://leiningen.org/#install).

## Our production system

Before we get started with any coding, let's be responsible engineers and do a little design. And before we get started with any design, let's be responsible engineers and ask our ["product owner" (this document)](product.md) what we're building.

After we're familiar with the product, we can start building it!

## Lessons

1. [Clojure and AWS, a match made in heaven](lesson-01.md)
2. Queuing with SQS (coming soon)
3. Hooking it all together with Lambda (coming soon)
